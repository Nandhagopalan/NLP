In
a
routine
company
health
check-up,
a
32-year-old
woman
presented
a
highly
elevated
serum
level
of
carbohydrate-deficient
transferrin
(CDT),
a
biomarker
for
excessive
alcohol
consumption.
The
test
result
(~17%
disialotransferrin,
reference
interval
&lt;2.0%;
~3%
asialotransferrin,
reference
0%)
was
confirmed
by
analysis
of
a
second
sample,
while
another
alcohol
biomarker,
phosphatidylethanol
(PEth)
in
whole-blood,
was
negative.
This
suggested
that
her
elevated
CDT
may
be
unrelated
to
heavy
drinking.
The
abnormal
type-1
transferrin
glycoform
pattern
indicated
a
defect
in
N-glycan
assembly
occurring
in
congenital
disorders
of
glycosylation
(CDG),
a
family
of
rare
inherited
metabolic
disorders.
Probing
for
the
underlying
enzyme
defect(s)
using
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
demonstrated
normal
activity
of
phosphomannomutase,
whereas
the
activity
of
phosphomannose
isomerase
(MPI)
was
reduced
(0.64
mU/mg
protein,
reference
2.1-6.9),
pointing
to
CDG
of
the
MPI
subtype
(formerly
called
CDG-Ib).
The
diagnosis
was
confirmed
by
sequence
analysis
of
the
MPI
gene
revealing
a
homozygous
missense
mutation
(c.656G&gt;A)
causing
replacement
of
arginine
by
glutamine
(p.R219Q).
However,
the
woman
had
never
experienced
any
clinical
manifestations
associated
with
MPI-CDG.
Both
parents,
being
distant
relatives,
were
heterozygous
mutation
carriers
with
normal
CDT
values.
Two
of
three
siblings
were
not
affected,
whereas
one
brother
was
also
homozygous
for
c.656G&gt;A
and
had
a
highly
elevated
CDT
and
no
clinical
symptoms.

The
mycotoxin
aflatoxin
B1
(AFB1)
may
initiate
cancer
by
causing
oxidatively
damaged
DNA,
specifically
by
causing
8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine
(8-oxodG)
lesions.
Base
excision
repair
removes
these
lesions,
with
8-oxoguanine
glycosylase
(OGG1)
being
the
rate-limiting
enzyme.
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
ogg1
deficiency
on
AFB1-induced
oxidatively
damaged
DNA
and
tumourigenesis.
Female
wild-type,
heterozygous
and
homozygous
ogg1
null
mice
were
given
a
single
dose
of
50mg/kg
AFB1
or
40
l
dimethyl
sulfoxide
(DMSO)
ip.
Neither
ogg1
genotype
nor
AFB1
treatment
affected
levels
of
oxidised
guanine
in
lung
or
liver
2h
post-treatment.
AFB1-treated
ogg1
null
mice
showed
exacerbated
weight
loss
and
mortality
relative
to
DMSO-treated
ogg1
null
mice,
but
AFB1
treatment
did
not
significantly
increase
lung
or
liver
tumour
incidence
compared
with
controls,
regardless
of
ogg1
genotype.
Suspect
lung
masses
from
three
of
the
AFB1-treated
mice
were
adenomas,
and
masses
from
two
of
the
mice
were
osteosarcomas.
No
osteosarcomas
were
observed
in
DMSO-treated
mice.
All
liver
masses
from
AFB1-treated
mice
were
adenomas,
and
one
also
contained
a
hepatocellular
carcinoma.
In
DNA
from
the
lung
tumours,
the
K-ras
mutation
pattern
was
inconsistent
with
initiation
by
AFB1.
In
conclusion,
ogg1
status
did
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
AFB1-induced
oxidatively
damaged
DNA
or
tumourigenesis,
but
deletion
of
one
or
both
alleles
of
ogg1
did
increase
susceptibility
to
other
aspects
of
AFB1
toxicity.

The
-opioid
receptor
is
the
primary
site
of
action
of
most
opioids.
The
118A&gt;G
(rs1799971)
polymorphism
in
exon
1
of
the
-opioid
receptor
gene
(OPRM1)
leads
to
an
Asn40Asp
amino
acid
change
that
affects
a
putative
N-glycosylation
site.
It
has
been
widely
investigated
for
association
with
alcohol
and
drug
dependence
and
pain
sensitivity,
with
mixed
results.
The
aim
of
the
current
study
was
to
examine
whether
this
polymorphism
was
associated
with
heroin
dependence
in
a
large
Bulgarian
cohort
of
1842
active
users
and
1451
population
controls.
SNP
genotyping
was
done
using
Real-Time
PCR
TaqMan
technology.
Association
analyses
were
conducted,
separately
for
Roma
and
non-Roma
participants.
Our
results
suggest
that
there
is
no
direct
effect
of
118A&gt;G
genotype
on
the
risk
for
heroin
dependence
among
active
heroin
users.

Ricin
is
a
highly
toxic
agent
derived
from
the
castor
bean
plant
(Ricinus
communis).
Poisoning
occurs
commonly
by
oral
ingestion
of
the
beans.
Injection
of
ricin
is
believed
to
be
more
lethal.
Ricin
is
a
large
glycosylated
protein
difficult
to
detect
in
clinical
samples.
Instead,
ricinine,
a
small
alkaloid
found
in
the
same
beans,
is
used
as
surrogate
marker
for
ricin
exposure.
We
describe
a
simple
LC-MS/MS
method
for
the
detection
of
ricinine
in
serum,
blood
and
urine,
validated
according
to
EMA
guidelines
and
successfully
applied
to
patient
samples
of
a
suicidal
death
after
injection
of
a
castor
bean
extract.
A
26-year-old
man
self-presented
to
the
emergency
department
with
severe
abdominal
cramps
and
nausea
after
injection
of
a
castor
bean
extract.
Due
to
rapid
deterioration
of
his
hemodynamic
function
despite
early
aggressive
fluid
resuscitation,
he
was
transferred
to
ICU.
Abdominal
cramps
worsened
and
a
fulminant
diarrhea
developed,
resulting
in
hypovolemic
shock
and
cardiorespiratory
collapse.
Despite
full
supportive
therapy,
the
patient
died
approximately
10
hours
after
injection
due
to
multiple
organ
failure.
Ricinine
was
quantified
by
LC-MS/MS
after
LLE
with
diethyl
ether
using
ricinine-D3
as
internal
standard.
Six
hours
after
injection,
ricinine
concentrations
in
serum
and
blood
were
16.5
and
12.9
ng/mL,
respectively,
which
decreased
to
12.4
and
10.6
ng/mL,
4
hours
later.
The
urinary
concentration
was
81.1
ng/mL
7
hours
after
injection,
which
amply
exceeded
the
levels
previously
reported
in
similar
cases
with
lethal
outcome.
Concentrations
of
ricinine,
compatible
with
a
lethal
exposure
to
castor
beans,
were
detected
in
serum,
blood
and
urine.
Ricinine
was
also
found
in
bile
and
liver
tissue.

Asialo-human
transferrin
(asialo-hTf)
is
a
glycoform
of
the
human
serum
protein
transferrin
characterized
by
the
lack
of
the
sialic
acid
(SA)
terminal
unit.
It
is
known
that
glycosylation
micro-heterogeneity
and
the
presence
of
SA
are
strongly
involved
in
protein
functioning
and
pathophysiological
activities.
Some
hTf
glycoforms
are
valuable
biomarkers
for
the
detection
of
both
genetic
defects
of
glycosylation
and/or
sialoform
distribution
changes.
The
detection
of
the
carbohydrate
deficient
transferrin
(CDT)
glycoforms
is
currently
a
widely
employed
method
for
the
diagnosis
of
chronic
alcohol
abuse.
The
physiological
significance
of
asialo-hTf
is
still
unclear,
despite
its
important
biological
implications.
The
current
knowledge
suggests
that
asialo-hTf
may
be
involved
in
regulation
of
iron
transport
and
release
at
the
hepatic
level,
which,
consequently,
could
strongly
be
affected
by
alcohol
consumption.
For
these
reasons,
a
deeper
understanding
of
asialo-hTf
structure
and
its
physiological
role
is
required,
and
an
improved
method
of
its
analysis
would
favor
the
detection
of
both
chronic
abuse
and
other
habits
of
alcohol
intake
and/or
misuse.
Thus,
suitable
analytical
methods
possessing
higher
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
comparison
with
the
currently
available
techniques
are
certainly
recommended.
The
present
review
summarizes
the
studies
on
asialo-hTf
structure,
roles,
and
detection
techniques
mainly
in
relation
to
its
possible
use
as
a
potentially
additional
useful
biomarker
of
alcohol
abuse,
and
underlines
its
prospective
value
as
a
forensic
and
diagnostic
tool.
